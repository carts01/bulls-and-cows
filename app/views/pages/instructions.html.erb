  <h2>How to play</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The aim of Bulls and Cows is to get four bulls:
    <ul>
      <li>Choose which level to play (easy, medium or hard)</li>
      <li>Enter in a four digit secret code - all four digits must be unique.</li>
      <li>Now try to guess the computers random four digit code!</li>
      <li>If you guess a number that is in the code and in the correct position, you will get one bull.</li>
      <li>If you guess a number that is in the code but it is not in the correct position, you will get one cow.</li>
      <li>Each round, the computer will also try and guess your secret code. If you get to four bulls first, you win the game.</li>
      <li>If at the end of 7 rounds, neither you nor the computer has four bulls, the game will end in a tie.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Levels</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bruce (Easy)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Bruce isn't very smart - he will just guess a random code each time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Judy (Medium)</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Judy is a bit smarter than Bruce - she will use any Bulls she finds to narrow down her guesses.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lionel (Hard)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Lionel is a smart fella - he will use both the Bulls and Cows he finds to narrow down his guesses. He will always get four bulls within 7 turns.</li>
    </ul>
